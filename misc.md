1. I maintain (rather irregularly) a [blog](https://paperpenandfilm.wordpress.com/) on the books I read and the films I watch.
2. I was an avid quizzer, and have taken part in, and hosted quite a few intercollegiate quizzes in my undergraduate days. These days, my quizzing is limited to events within IISc (during Pravega, primarily).
At IISc, I have twice co-hosted the general quizzes as part of the Open Day celebrations at the ECE department.
3. In a much earlier avatar, I was a part of the [Indian Schools Debating Society](https://indianschoolsdebatingsociety.com/). The tournaments then were hosted almost exclusively between schools in Chennai, but the organization has now expanded greatly to include schools from all over India. The debates followed the format of the [World Schools Style](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Schools_Style_debate).
