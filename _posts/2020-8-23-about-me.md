I am a third-year PhD student at the [Department of Electrical Communication Engineering](https://ece.iisc.ac.in/) at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru. I am advised by [Prof. Navin Kashyap](https://ece.iisc.ac.in/~nkashyap/). I received the B.E. (Hons.) degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from BITS, Pilani--Hyderabad Campus, in 2018, graduating with a gold medal. 

My research interests are broadly in the field of information theory, with particular focus on the computation of capacity of finite-state channels. I have, in the past, worked on the design of codes for distributed storage, and on matchings in bipartite graphs, with preferences.

My CV (last updated July 2020) is here: [Curriculum Vitae]({{ site.baseurl }}/CV_July_20.pdf)
